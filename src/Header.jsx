        <h2>Fun with Statistics</h2>
        <p>
            Here, you will learn about various types of statistics. You will enter your own set of numbers from which statistics
            such as the mean, the median, and the standard deviation are calculated, and you will get to see those results.
            I hope that this provides you an enjoyable way of learning statistics!
